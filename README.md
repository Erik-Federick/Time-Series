## Overview
Time series forecasting is a branch of predictive analytics that deals with predicting future values based on historical data points. In this project, we aim to forecast commodity prices, such as corn, using LSTM neural networks, which are well-suited for handling sequential data.

## Results
The LSTM-based model demonstrates promising results in predicting commodity prices. By analyzing evaluation metrics and visualization outputs, we can gain valuable insights into the model's performance and its ability to forecast future prices accurately. The project results section provides detailed analyses and visualizations to aid in understanding the model's behavior and effectiveness.

## Model Evaluation
The trained model is rigorously evaluated using various metrics, including MAE (Mean Absolute Error), loss, and visualization outputs. Through comprehensive evaluation, we can assess the model's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Detailed analyses of evaluation metrics are provided to facilitate a deeper understanding of the model's performance.s.
